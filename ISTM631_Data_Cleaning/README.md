# ISTM 631 â€“ Data Cleaning Using Python

**Course:** ISTM 631 â€“ Business Analytics Programming  
**Project:** Data Pre-processing and Cleaning (Project 2)  
**Team Members:** Yisi Lu, Kenny Lei, Alex Fan  
**Dataset:** Cafe Sales Dataset (Kaggle)  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy

## ðŸ§¼ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to clean a raw sales dataset from a cafe that contained numerous data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, incorrect data types, and duplicate entries. Using Python, we implemented a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline consisting of eight distinct steps, followed by a visualization of the cleaned dataset using the `pandas` plotting utility.

## ðŸ§¾ Report Breakdown

### 1. ðŸ“¥ Data Collection

We selected the **Cafe Sales** dataset from Kaggle, which includes 10,000 rows and 8 columns spanning numerical, categorical, and date/time data types. It was chosen specifically for its realistic messiness:
- Missing or incorrect values
- Mixed data types
- Duplicates and inconsistent formatting
- Invalid transaction dates
- Mismatches in calculated totals

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Process

We performed the following **8 distinct data cleaning steps**:

1. **Remove Duplicates** â€“ Eliminated repeated rows.
2. **Convert Data Types** â€“ Ensured numeric fields were stored as numerical types.
3. **Impute Missing Values** â€“ Used median for numeric and mode for categorical data.
4. **Standardize Text Fields** â€“ Converted to title case and removed leading/trailing whitespace.
5. **Fix Date Formats** â€“ Converted 'Transaction Date' to proper datetime format.
6. **Drop Invalid Dates** â€“ Removed rows where date parsing failed.
7. **Correct Calculations** â€“ Recalculated `Total Spent` and corrected mismatches.
8. **Reset Index** â€“ Reindexed the cleaned DataFrame for clarity.

### 3. ðŸ“Š Final Dataset Summary

| Metric           | Before Cleaning | After Cleaning |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Rows             | 10,000           | 9,540          |
| Columns          | 8                | 8              |
| Data Type Issues | Present          | Resolved       |

All columns now contain valid, consistently formatted, and correctly typed data.

### 4. ðŸ“ˆ Plot the Clean Data

We visualized the **total sales by payment method** using a horizontal bar chart built with `pandas.plot()`.

- Grouped data by `Payment Method`
- Summed the `Total Spent`
- Sorted the results for better readability
- Labeled the bars with exact dollar amounts

âœ… This plot provides quick insight into which payment methods are most used by customers.

### 5. ðŸ”§ Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                                               | How We Addressed It                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type conversions caused script crashes on bad input      | Used `errors='coerce'` for safe type handling                |
| Detecting incorrect totals across rows                   | Used `np.abs()` with logical masking to catch inaccuracies   |
| Partial correction logic in early drafts                 | Improved targeting via Boolean masks                        |
| Summarizing by group was messy with raw data             | Used `groupby` + `agg()` for clean, efficient summarization  |
| Cleaned file was misplaced                               | Used `os.path.abspath()` to confirm save location            |
